## The Website-porftolio for Full Stack Web-developer
The main purpose of the website is to help potential clients or potential employees to get know the full stack web developer and to make decision whether he/she suits for particular project or job. 
## Technologies used in the project:
1. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
2. React 17.0.2
3. SCSS 
3. NodeJS 14.x
4. MongoDB  
5. Express 4.17.1

I used React library in order to keep component based approach and keep my code more clean and structured. CSS-code was written with using preprocessor SCSS in order to make the 
cumbersome CSS-code more structured and optimized. NodeJS(js run-time environment) and Express(server-side js framework) provided me the server-side of Web-site that allowed me to 
implement the next feauters: to send mail from web-site and to unload data (Frontend-developer projects data) from the database MongoDB.
