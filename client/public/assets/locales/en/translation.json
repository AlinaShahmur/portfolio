    "my_story":"Hello everyone! My name is Alina and  I am Frontend Developer. I am passionate about web development and new technologies and like to build scalable user interfaces. My specialization is frontend development, but in general I also familiar with server-side technologies and the working principle of the web server. I graduated from Novosibirsk State Technical University. I have a bachelor's degree in Applied computer science in economics.Now I live in Israel. When I moved to Israel I decided that first of all I need to learn the Hebrew language. After 2 years of my residence in Israel I started to learn Web development independently and when I realized that I would like to develop in this sphere I took the full stack web development frontal course in Technion continuing education. I have built some independent projects and within the course as well. You can get to know with some of them on my GitHub profile and on my Web site portfolio."
